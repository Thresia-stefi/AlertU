how does it works

User Registration

    Students register on the AlertU website with their university credentials.
    They customize their notification preferences, selecting the types of alerts they want to receive.

Data Integration

    AlertU integrates with the university's database to access relevant information.
    The system collects data on class schedules, exam results, scholarships, internships, and campus events.

Alert System

    AlertU's algorithm matches the collected data with each student's notification preferences.
    The system sends personalized alerts and notifications to students via email, SMS, or in-app notifications.

User Interface

    Students can log in to the AlertU website to view their dashboard.
    The dashboard displays relevant information, such as upcoming events, deadlines, and announcements.

By following these steps, AlertU provides students with a personalized and streamlined way to stay informed about important university updates.
